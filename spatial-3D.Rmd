## Mapping concentrations of geochemical elements

Ensemble ML can also be used for mapping soil variables in 3D. Consider for example 
the Geochemical and minerological data set for USA48 [@smith2014geochemical]. This is a public data set 
produced and maintained by the USA Geological Survey and contains laboratory measurements 
of chemical elements and minerals in soil at 4,857 sites (for three depths 0 to 5 cm, 
A horizon and C horizon; Fig. \@ref(fig:ds801-example)).

We can load the regression matrix which contains all target variables and covariates:

```{r}
ds801 = readRDS("./input/ds801_geochem1km.rds")
dim(ds801)
```

with a total of unique locations:

```{r}
str(levels(as.factor(ds801$olc_id)))
```

The individual records can be browsed directly via <https://mrdata.usgs.gov/ngdb/soil/>, 
for example a single record includes:

```{r ds801-example, echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Example of a geochemical sample with observations and measurements and coordiates of site."}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Fig_geochemical_USGS_record.jpg")
```

Covariates prepared to help interpolation of the geochemicals include:

- Distance to cities [@nelson2019suite];  
- [MODIS LST](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1420114) (monthly daytime and nighttime);  
- [MODIS EVI](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13q1v006/) (long-term monthly values);  
- [Lights at night images](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/dmsp/);  
- [Snow occurrence probability](https://climate.esa.int/en/odp/#/project/snow);  
- Soil property and class maps for USA48 [@ramcharan2018soil];  
- Terrain / hydrological indices;  

We can focus on predict concentration of lead (Pb). This variable seems to change 
with depth but less for different land cover classes:

```{r cor-depth, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Distribution of Pb as a function of land cover classes."}
openair::scatterPlot(ds801[ds801$pb_ppm<140,], x = "hzn_depth", y = "pb_ppm", method = "hexbin", col = "increment", log.x=TRUE, log.y=TRUE, xlab="Depth", ylab="Pb [ppm]", z.lim=c(0,100), type="landcover1")
```


Because we are aiming at producing predictions of geochemical elements for different 
depths in soil, we can also use depth of the soil sample as one of the covariates. 
To fit a RF model for this data we can use:

```{r}
ds801$log.pb = log1p(ds801$pb_ppm)
pr.vars = readRDS("./input/pb.pr.vars.rds")
sel.pb = complete.cases(ds801[,c("log.pb", pr.vars)])
mrf = ranger::ranger(y=ds801$log.pb[sel.pb], x=ds801[sel.pb, pr.vars], 
            num.trees = 85, importance = 'impurity')
mrf
```

which results in R-square of about 0.56. Because many training points have exactly 
the same coordinates (same site, three depths), we assume that this model is over-fitting and the out-of-bag 
accuracy is probably over-optimistic. Instead we can fit an Ensemble model where 
we block points within 30 by 30-km blocks:

```{r, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
if(!exists("eml.pb")){
  lrn.rf = mlr::makeLearner("regr.ranger", num.trees=85, importance="impurity",
                            num.threads = parallel::detectCores())
  lrns.pb <- list(lrn.rf, mlr::makeLearner("regr.xgboost"), mlr::makeLearner("regr.cvglmnet"))
  tsk0.pb <- mlr::makeRegrTask(data = ds801[sel.pb, c("log.pb", pr.vars)], 
                               target = "log.pb", blocking = as.factor(ds801$ID[sel.pb]))
  init.pb <- mlr::makeStackedLearner(lrns.pb, method="stack.cv", super.learner="regr.lm", 
                                      resampling=mlr::makeResampleDesc(method="CV", blocking.cv=TRUE))
  parallelMap::parallelStartSocket(parallel::detectCores())
  eml.pb = train(init.pb, tsk0.pb)
  parallelMap::parallelStop()
}
```

```{r}
summary(eml.pb$learner.model$super.model$learner.model)
```

which shows somewhat lower R-square of 0.44, this time that whole sites have 
been taken out this seems to be also somewhat more realistic estimate of the 
mapping accuracy. The accuracy plot shows that the model has some problems with predicting 
higher values, but overall matches the observed values:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
t.pb = quantile(ds801$log.pb, c(0.001, 0.01, 0.999), na.rm=TRUE)
plot_hexbin(varn="log.pb", breaks=c(t.pb[1], seq(t.pb[2], t.pb[3], length=25)), 
      meas=eml.pb$learner.model$super.model$learner.model$model$log.pb, 
      pred=eml.pb$learner.model$super.model$learner.model$fitted.values,
      main="Pb [EML]")
```

```{r ac-pb1, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Accuracy plot for Pb concentration in soil fitted using Ensemble ML.", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/plot_CV_log.pb.png")
```

Variables most important for explaining distribution of the target variable (based on the variable importance)
seem to be soil depth, annual day time temperature and travel time to cities. 
If we plot the travel time to cities vs Pb concentrations, we can clearly see that 
Pb is negatively correlated with travel time to cities:

```{r cor-cities, echo=TRUE, fig.width=8, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Distribution of Pb as a function of travel time to cities for different depths."}
openair::scatterPlot(ds801[ds801$pb_ppm<140,], x = "travel_time_to_cities_1_usa48", y = "pb_ppm", method = "hexbin", col = "increment", log.x=TRUE, log.y=TRUE, xlab="Travel time to cities 1", ylab="Pb [ppm]", type="hzn_depth")
```

## Predictions in 3D

To produce predictions we can focus on area around Chicago conglomeration. We can 
load the covariate layers by using:

```{r}
g1km = readRDS("./input/chicago_grid1km.rds")
```

This contains all layers we used for training. We can generate predictions by 
specifying the depth at which we wish to predict:

```{r}
for(k in c(5, 30, 60)){
  out.tif = paste0("./output/pb_ppm_", k, "cm_1km.tif")
  if(!file.exists(out.tif)){
    g1km$hzn_depth = k
    sel.na = complete.cases(g1km)
    newdata = g1km[sel.na, eml.pb$features]
    pred = predict(eml.pb, newdata=newdata)
    g1km.sp = SpatialPixelsDataFrame(as.matrix(g1km[sel.na,c("x","y")]), 
                data=pred$data, proj4string=CRS("EPSG:5070"))
    g1km.sp$pred = expm1(g1km.sp$response)
    rgdal::writeGDAL(g1km.sp["pred"], out.tif, type="Int16", mvFlag=-32768, options=c("COMPRESS=DEFLATE"))
    #gc()
  }
}
```

This finally gives the following pattern:

```{r pred-pb1, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.cap="Predictions of Pb concentration for different soil depths based on Ensemble ML. Red color indicates high values. Values of Pb clearly drop with soil depth.", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Pb_predictions_d1.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Pb_predictions_d2.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("./img/Pb_predictions_d3.jpg")
```

In general it can be said that:

1. Distribution of Pb across USA seem to be controlled by a mixture of factors 
   including climatic factors and anthropogenic factors (travel distance to cities);  
2. Overall big urban areas show significantly higher concentrations for some heavy 
   metals;  
3. Soil depth for some geochemical elements comes as the overall most important 
   covariate hence mapping soil variables in 3D is fully justified;


## Advantages and limitations of running 3D predictive mapping

In summary 3D soil mapping is relatively straight forward to implement especially 
for mapping soil variables from soil profile samples. Before modeling the target 
variable with depth, it is a good idea to plot relationship between target variable 
and depth under different settings (as in Fig. \@ref(fig:cor-depth)). 3D soil mapping 
based on Machine Learning is now increasingly common [@sothe2022large].

A serious limitation for 3D predictive mapping is the size of data i.e. data volumes 
increasing proportionally to number of slices we need to predict. Also, we show that 
points with exactly the same coordinates might result in e.g. Random Forest overfitting 
emphasizing some covariate layers that are possibly less important, hence it is 
again important to use the blocking parameter that separates training and validation 
points.

Soil depth is for many soil variables most important explanatory variables, but 
in the cases it does not correlate with the target variable, probably there is 
probably also no need for 3D soil mapping. In the case depth is not significantly 
correlated one could simply first aggregate all values to block depth and convert modeling to 2D.
